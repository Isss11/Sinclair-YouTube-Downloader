# YouTube-Video-Downloader
This was a program that I created to learn a little about Tkinter and PyTube. It is NOT intended for commercial purposes.

To use it, make sure to include both the sound file and main.py (just download this repository as a zip). Once you have it set-up, it should be fairly self-explanatory how to use it. Keep in mind, that if you prove an invalid file path name, there will be one that is created within the current working directory.

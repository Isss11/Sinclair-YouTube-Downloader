# Sinclair-YouTube-Downloader
This was a program that I created to learn about Tkinter and PyTube. It is NOT intended for commercial purposes.

Sinclair YouTube Downloader is an application that downloads YouTube videos of varying requested file types. Users are asked to provide a link to the video, and can choose different kinds of file download options (such as audio-only file types and resolution choices for videos) to acquire the kind of file they want.

**Set-Up:**
To set it up, download these files through the ZIP folder option. The only other thing you may have to do is re-download (and replace the ones in the ZIP folder) the TCL themes [here](https://github.com/rdbende/Sun-Valley-ttk-theme) should they not work on your device.
